# LOTUS Reader
The LOTUS Reader is a GUI primarily built to read and compile raw Empatica EmbracePlus data over user-defined periods of time. Fragmented 'chunks' of raw timeseries data output by Empatica (i.e., EDA, BVP, systolic peaks, temperature, accelerometer, and event tags) can be selectively reconstituted as continuous timeseries for further processing.
